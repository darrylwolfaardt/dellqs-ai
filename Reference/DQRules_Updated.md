# DQRules - Dell Quantity Surveying AI Measurement Rules

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Based on:** ASAQS Standard System of Measuring Building Work - Seventh Edition (2015)  
**Reference:** AAQS Model Bills of Quantities with Rules

---

## PURPOSE AND SCOPE

These rules provide guidance for measuring building work in accordance with South African standards for preparing Bills of Quantities. The rules are based on the Standard System SSM7 2015 published by the Association of South African Quantity Surveyors (ASAQS).

---

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES

### 1. MEASUREMENT APPROACH

**Net Measurements:**
- All work measured net as fixed in position
- Deduct all wants/voids
- No allowance for waste except where specified
- Round each measurement to nearest 10mm (5mm+ = 10mm, under 5mm = disregard)
- This rounding rule does NOT apply to dimensions stated in descriptions

**Fractional Quantities:**
- Round to nearest whole unit
- Where value is significant, give to 2 decimal places

**Units of Measurement:**
- ha (hectare)
- kg (kilogram)
- kN (kilonewton)
- kW (kilowatt)
- m (linear metre)
- m² (square metre)
- m³ (cubic metre)
- mm (millimetre)
- No (number)
- t (ton/tonne)

### 2. BILL STRUCTURE

**Format:**
- Item No | Description | Unit | Quantity | Rate | Amount

**Order of Items:**
- Divide into trades per SSM7 order
- Within trades: mass → volume → area → length → number
- Items by approximate value: cheapest first
- Ancillary work in relevant trade

**Dimensions Sequence:**
1. Horizontal perpendicular to line of sight
2. Horizontal parallel to line of sight
3. Vertical
